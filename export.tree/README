This dataset includes raw neuroimaging data from the neuroimaging of primary trigeminal neuralgia study, collected at Federal Neurosurgical Center, Novosibirsk, Russia. 
Data were collected between 2022 and 2024. Participants were adults with diagnosed primary trigeminal neuralgia (according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria). 

This dataset includes high-resolution 3D_T1w_TFE, 3D_T2w, DTI with 64 diffusion direction, and resting state bold-fMRI data.  Anatomical scans were defaced using pydeface software. 

MRI data were collected for 112 patients with PTN, organized in folders labeled sub- ***, and 48 healthy volunteers in folders labeled sub- **. Furthermore, 6-month follow-up MRI data are available for 58 patients, stored in folders labeled sub- ***fu.

Clinical and demographic information for each participant, along with primary MRI findings, neurovascular compression grade (according to Sindou classification, if suitable), and the surgical procedure type are provided in the “participants.tsv” file. 

The "mriqc_data" folder contains information on image quality metrics for T1w, T2w, DWI and BOLD images calculated in a group analysis format for all patients. Raw data for each patient is available upon request to the dataset authors.
